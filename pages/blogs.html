            I think writing blogs is the best way to learn things. Sometimes it's also helpful to concretize a 
        concept I learnt recently. Here are some blogs that I have written:

    <div class="blog_body">
        From scanned PDFs to text summarization:
    </br></br>
    TLDR; The article discusses about basics of data extraction from scanned PDFs. I have shared my experience
            in performing Optical Character recognition(OCR) on PDFs and used two different libraries, OCRPus and Tesseract for text extraction.

        UNDERSTANDING THE DATA : Things you might miss!!
        </br></br>
        TLDR; The following article deals with the measures of statistical analysis for univarite( analysis on one variable) and 
        bivariate(analysis between two variable). You can easily find codes for 
        these in the language you use for doing exploration.

            Data analysis and statistical inference : A quick guide
            </br></br>
            TLDR; The article further deep dives into statistical tests for discrete and continuous and discrete 
            variables. I have included example codes in R.

            Data Analysis and Statistical Inference: A Quick Guide Part 2 (ANOVA)
            </br></br>
            TLDR; The article discusses about making inferences between a categorical and continuous variable using ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance).
            This could be essential when you are making hypothesis upon a continuous quantity like housing price vs 
            a categorical quantity like income class of the people.
