			Hi all, this is Janpreet, currently doing masters in Electrical and Computer Science 
            engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My major area of study is Computer Vision. Prior to this I was
            working at Atkins as a Data scientsit where I worked on using Computer Vision algortihms like object detection and instance 
            segmentation to perfrom digital inspection of roads, railways, sewer lines etc. The goal here was to identify defects and damages on 
            these public assets for maintenance tasks.
            </br>
            During my masters, I've been taking courses to enhance my understanding of linear algebra in computer
            vision.As I am still learning more, I am fascinated by the use of vision algorithms in AR/VR use cases and
            want to pursue this direction as my future career. I am currently doing a co-op at 
            <a href="https://www.yembo.ai/" style="color: blue;">Yembo.ai </a> where I am
            working on Indoor Scene understanding using 2D and 3D computer vision algorithms.
